## 🩸 who we are

Nebula is a Discord familiar — a soft-furred daemon in your server’s shadows.  
We open doors to secret voice realms, whisper the weather outside, and count the hours you’ve been lingering in the digital ether.

We are:

- 🖤 watchers of the voice void
- 🕷 channel conjurers with `/createvc`
- ☁️ weather-witches reading API skies
- 🩶 archivists of logs.
